Make a machine or system that makes art. This can be anything from a Twitter bot to a robot with a paintbrush to a hacked TV. You are creating the rules of a system that creates. Consider the inputs and outputs of the system you are creating. Where can you add parameters that allow you to tweak aspects of the output? When your machine makes art for the first time, consider if what it has made is a collaboration or not.
